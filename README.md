This project develops a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict individual medical insurance costs using demographic and health-related features. Accurate cost prediction is essential for insurance planning and risk assessment. The model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 39,435,416.86, a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 6,279.76, and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4,371.68, indicating that predictions were reasonably close to actual medical charges despite the presence of high-cost outliers (e.g., charges above R60,000). The model obtained an R² score of 76%, demonstrating a strong alignment between predicted and actual cost variance. These findings support the effectiveness of linear regression for medical cost estimation, while also highlighting the importance of comparing multiple models to improve predictive accuracy, fairness, and reliability in insurance decision-making.
